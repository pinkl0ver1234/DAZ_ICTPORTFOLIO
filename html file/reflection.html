<h2 style="font-family:fantasy;color:hotpink"> REFLECTION FOR FIRST QTR </h2>
<p style ="font-family:trebuchet ms;color:white"> My first quarter in ICT was difficult. I really had a hard time understanding ICT and coding. But I have friends that help me go through all of these difficulties. I’m grateful to have a teacher like Ms. Uminga who is understanding and good at teaching. She’s funny and caring. I thank my friends, Gab, Rodilyn, Angel, Raven, Raina, and Jolynne. I thank them for supporting me and helping me whenever I need help. This quarter was difficult but I enjoyed the journey!  </h3>

<h2 style="font-family:fantasy;color:hotpink"> REFLECTION FOR SECOND QTR </h2>
<p style ="font-family:trebuchet ms;color:white"> Time surely flies by really quickly! I can't believe that 2nd quarter is almost done, and I'm growing up! This second quarter of ICT has been really easy for me! CSS is really easier, I thought my classmates who are good in ICT are lying when they told me CSS is easier, but they were not wrong! <br> <br> <br>I'm grateful for Ms. Uminga this second quarter because she's SUPER I mean SUPERR!!!!, generous when it comes to giving her time to do our school and group projects. She also understands us whenever we want to move a quiz or a summative. She has been the most generous teacher ever! <br> <br> <br> And I mean it with my whole heart! So, Ms. Uminga if you're reading thing (I know po you will hehe) Thank you so much for being so generous and a good teacher. We love you! And this third quarter, I want to learn more about ICT thought it may not be easy, I will go through it with the support of my friends. <3   </h3>
